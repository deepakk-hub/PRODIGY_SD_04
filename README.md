# PRODIGY_SD_04
A C++ GUI-based Sudoku Solver using Win32 API that solves puzzles using backtracking algorithm.
PRODIGY_WD_04 - Sudoku Solver
This repository contains the fourth task of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under the Web Development Track.

üöÄ Task Objective
Create a C++ GUI-based application using the Win32 API to solve Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program:

Accepts an input grid (GUI-based)
Uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in missing numbers
Displays the solved puzzle on the same GUI interface
üß† What I Learned
Implementing the backtracking algorithm to solve constraint satisfaction problems
Designing an interactive GUI with C++ Win32 API
Managing 2D arrays, recursion, and control flow efficiently
Debugging complex recursive logic
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Language: C++
Framework: Win32 API
IDE: Visual Studio
Algorithm: Backtracking
